# Claude Permanent Instructions for WIG Project

## Status Reporting Protocol

**CRITICAL: Report status every 10 minutes and every time handing back the prompt**

### Required Status Fields:
1. **Date & Time** - Current date/time
2. **Last Successful Build** - Git commit hash of last working build
3. **Last Commit in Successful Build** - Commit message
4. **Version** - Current app version
5. **Date Deployed** - When last deployed
6. **Last Deployed Build** - Git commit of deployed version
7. **Test Coverage** - Overall % and breakdown by area (unit, integration, e2e)
8. **Project Status** - Current phase, what's working, what's blocked
9. **Next Steps** - Immediate next actions
10. **Your Recommendation** - What should be prioritized

### Format:
```
*******************************************************************************
STATUS UPDATE - [Date] [Time]
*******************************************************************************
Last Successful Build: [commit hash]
Last Commit: [commit message]

*******************************************************************************
```

### Behavior:
- **DO NOT STOP** - Continue working and provide updates every 10 minutes
- Always include update when returning prompt to user
- Surround update with asterisks (*)
- **NEVER ASK USER QUESTIONS ABOUT NEXT STEPS**
- Tell user what you're doing and move on
- Don't assume user will read or direct you
- Make your own decisions on what's best
- Just keep working continuously
- Test after every deployment

## Testing & Deployment Protocol

**CRITICAL: All new features must have E2E test coverage**

### E2E Test Requirements:
- Every new feature MUST have corresponding E2E test created by planners
- Tests MUST run before and after every deploy
- All tests must pass before deployment proceeds
- Use Playwright for E2E testing
- Tests located in: apps/web/tests/e2e/

### Test Coverage Requirements:
- **Target: 100% test coverage for all features**
- If test coverage is less than 100%, PRIORITIZE testing above all other progress
- Maintain test coverage statistics (unit, integration, e2e)
- QA engineers must track and report coverage in every status update
- Show coverage stats in 10-minute status reports

### Deployment Frequency:
- **Deploy new version at least once every hour**
- Ensure all tests pass before deployment
- Update version number with each deployment
- Document changes in git commit messages
