=== WIG UI Design Spec ===
Warm Intro Graph - UI Design Spec (Wireframe Level)Initial screens, component map, low-fidelity wireframes, and interaction specificationVersion: v1.0 | Date: 2026-01-171. OverviewThis document defines the initial Warm Intro Graph (WIG) user interface at wireframe level. It includes (1) a component map (React/Next.js-oriented), (2) low-fidelity wireframes for the MVP screens, and (3) a clickable interaction specification describing how key UI elements behave.1.1 Design goalsOptimize for the core loop: Target - Paths - Evidence - Action.Make trust visible: every recommendation is backed by inspectable evidence.Keep the interface fast and legible with dense but scannable panels.Support safe automation: default to draft-only and explicit approvals.Enable extensibility: new sources and action channels should plug in without UI rewrites.1.2 MVP screen setIntro Finder (primary workflow)Data Sources (connectors, sync status, imports)Review Queue (identity/merge approvals)Tasks & Follow-ups (execution tracking)2. Screen inventory and navigation2.1 App shellPersistent layout elements across the app:Left navigation: Intro Finder, People, Organizations, Graph Explorer, Tasks, Data Sources, Review Queue, Automations, Settings.Top bar: global search/command bar, New Intro button, sync health indicator, notifications, user menu.Optional right drawer: Manager Agent panel (collapsible).2.2 Navigation mapIntro Finder  -> Person Profile (from node click)  -> Tasks (from Create Task / Follow-up)  -> Review Queue (from merge warning / low confidence)Data Sources  -> Source Detail (logs, errors, re-sync)Review Queue  -> Merge Decision DetailTasks & Follow-ups  -> Intro Attempt Detail (path + drafts + status)3.

Clickable interaction specificationThis section defines click behaviors and state transitions for the MVP. It is written as a 'contract' between product and engineering.5.1 Global interactionsGlobal search/command barTyping searches People/Organizations and recent Targets.Enter on a person opens Intro Finder with that person set as Target.Enter on a command (e.g., 'Sync HubSpot') navigates to Data Sources and triggers sync confirmation modal.Sync status widgetClick opens Data Sources with source cards sorted by health (errors first).Tooltip shows: last successful sync timestamp and most recent error summary.5.2 Intro Finder interactionsIF-01 Target selectionUser types in TargetPicker.System shows disambiguation results (name + company + title).User selects target.System loads candidate paths (auto-run if enabled) and sets page state to Loading.IF-02 Find Warm IntroClick triggers pathfinding with current constraints.While running: disable button, show inline spinner, keep previous results visible until new results return.On success: Path list refreshes, graph highlights top path, DetailsPanel opens Evidence tab.On failure: show non-blocking error banner; keep last known results.IF-03 Path card actionsSelect: updates selectedPath; graph highlights it; DetailsPanel refreshes evidence grouped by edges.Generate intro request: opens Outreach tab and preselects recommended introducer (first hop by default).Compare: adds card to CompareTray; compare view shows differences in edge strengths and evidence recency.IF-04 Graph interactionsClick node: loads Person Profile preview in DetailsPanel context (or a drawer) without navigation.Click edge: opens EdgeEvidenceTooltip with evidence list; selecting an evidence item scrolls Evidence tab to that edge.Expand neighbors: fetches additional nodes/edges for that node (bounded by a max node count).Center on path: resets zoom and centers the selected path.IF-05 Outreach compositionUser opens Outreach tab.System renders a step list (Step 1: ask A; Step 2: ask B; ...).User clicks Generate Draft for a step.System produces editable draft text plus metadata (channel recommendation, tone, evidence references).User either: (a) saves draft, (b) queues for approval, or (c) sends (if enabled).When queued/sent, system creates/updates tasks and logs an audit event.5.3 Data Sources interactionsDS-01 Connect sourceClick Add source opens source picker modal.Selecting a source starts OAuth or import flow.On success: show sync progress (counts + status).On error: show error summary with retry and 'view logs'.DS-02 Run syncClick Sync Now triggers background job.UI shows 'sync queued' then live updates via polling or server events.When finished: update last sync timestamp; if merge suggestions produced, badge Review Queue in nav.5.4 Review Queue interactionsRQ-01 Review mergeUser selects a merge suggestion.System shows side-by-side records and the merge rationale.User clicks Approve or Reject.System applies decision, records audit entry, and updates downstream graph indices.If approved: offer Undo for a limited window and store reversible merge record.5.5 Tasks and follow-ups interactionsTK-01 Create tasks from outreachWhen user queues/sends a step, system automatically creates a follow-up task (default +3 days) unless disabled.Tasks link back to the relevant intro attempt and selected path.TK-02 Task completionMark done updates status and logs completion.If a follow-up is marked done with 'no response', system suggests alternate paths and offers a one-click recompose.5.6 Permission and safety behaviorsDefault outbound behavior is Draft-only. 'Send' controls are hidden unless a broker is configured and safety mode allows.Any send action must produce an audit record with: channel, recipient, content hash, timestamp, and initiating user.Rate limits and quiet hours (if configured) block sends and convert them to queued drafts.6. Appendix6.1 Suggested implementation notesPrefer a three-panel desktop layout for speed; on mobile, stack panels with a bottom nav and a persistent 'Selected Path' mini-header.Keep graph expansion bounded (max nodes) and provide strong filtering to prevent visual overload.Treat identity resolution as a first-class UI workflow; trust depends on it.



=== LinkedIn Adapter Design Spec ===
LinkedIn Adapter Design SpecificationWarm Intro Graph (WIG) - v1.0StatusDraft (Implementation-ready)OwnerWIG Chief Architect / Integrations TeamLast updated2026-01-24Primary modeLinkedIn Data Archive Import (compliant-by-default)1. Executive summaryThis document specifies the design and implementation of a LinkedIn source adapter for WIG (Warm Intro Graph). The adapter ingests LinkedIn-derived data into the canonical graph model to improve relationship-strength scoring and warm-intro pathfinding.The design is driven by three realities:LinkedIn's official APIs that expose connections and inbox capabilities are restricted to approved partner programs, and the Connections API does not allow browsing second-degree connections (i.e., you cannot fetch "other people's connections").LinkedIn's terms and help guidance prohibit the use of automated software, bots, crawlers, and browser plug-ins/extensions to scrape/copy data or automate LinkedIn activity. This makes RPA/screen-scrape approaches high-risk without explicit written permission.LinkedIn provides a native "download your data" archive export that includes, at minimum, your first-degree connections and direct message history; this is the most practical and low-risk ingestion method for v1.Accordingly, v1 ships in "Compliant Mode" (archive import). The adapter is also designed to support a future "Partner API Mode" if you obtain LinkedIn approval for restricted permissions.2. Goals and non-goals2.1 GoalsIngest LinkedIn data (connections, messages, posts where available) and normalize it into WIG canonical entities, edges, and evidence events.Improve relationship-strength scoring and explainability using LinkedIn-specific interaction signals (recency, frequency, reciprocity, connection age).Support warm-intro pathfinding and UI visualization using LinkedIn-derived edges and evidence.Provide a safe, auditable ingestion pipeline with strong privacy controls and deterministic idempotency.Preserve extensibility: add/upgrade LinkedIn ingestion methods without changing core graph logic.2.2 Non-goals (v1)Automated scraping of LinkedIn web pages (headless browser, DOM scraping, screen capture, VM-based RPA).Full extraction of other members' connection graphs (beyond opt-in methods described in Section 10).Real-time inbox sync via LinkedIn APIs (unless partner access is obtained).3. Requirements3.1 Functional requirementsFR-1: Ingest your first-degree connections (people + connection date where available).FR-2: Ingest your LinkedIn direct messages (conversation membership + message events, and optionally encrypted message bodies).FR-3: Ingest additional valuable signals from the archive when available (posts, comments, invitations, profile data, imported contacts).FR-4: Convert ingested data into canonical WIG evidence events that can drive scoring and explainability.FR-5: Provide job-based ingestion (upload  process  status  results) with resumability and idempotency.FR-6: Support data deletion and re-import for privacy and refresh.FR-7: Support an explicit strategy for "other people's connections" that is compliant (opt-in/confirmed/inferred).3.2 Non-functional requirementsNFR-1: Security - encrypt secrets and (optionally) message content at rest; least-privilege access to raw exports.NFR-2: Compliance - default mode must avoid automation/scraping patterns likely prohibited by LinkedIn policies.NFR-3: Auditability - every entity merge and every graph edge must be explainable and reversible.NFR-4: Testability - unit + integration + end-to-end tests are mandatory; CI must gate deployment on them.NFR-5: Performance - ingestion must be chunked and resumable to fit serverless constraints; pathfinding impact must be bounded.4. Constraints and policy landscapeLinkedIn's public developer documentation and related legal commentary indicate that access to member connections and inbox-like communications is typically restricted to approved partner programs. The Connections API explicitly disallows browsing "connections of connections" (second-degree networks). In parallel, LinkedIn's policies prohibit the use of automation, bots, crawlers, and similar software to scrape or copy data and to automate activity on LinkedIn.Implications for WIG:We can reliably ingest your own first-degree connections and message history via the LinkedIn data archive export.We cannot responsibly promise automated ingestion of LinkedIn inbox/messages via API unless you have partner access.We cannot fetch other people's full connections via API; any "other people's connections" capability must be opt-in or inferred.Any RPA/screen-capture approach should be treated as Experimental/High-Risk and gated behind explicit user acknowledgement and legal review.5. Integration approaches consideredThe adapter design supports multiple acquisition approaches. v1 implements the recommended approach and leaves clean extension points for the others.ApproachWhat it can collectFeasibility (v1)RiskNotesA. LinkedIn Data Archive Import (ZIP/CSV/JSON)Your connections; direct messages; posts/articles; potentially comments, invitations, and other exported categories.HighLowBest default. Requires manual export download + upload.B. Official LinkedIn APIs (OpenID Connect)Your identity (lite profile) and email depending on scopes.MediumLowUseful for verification and enriching "Me"; does not provide connections or inbox by default.C. Official LinkedIn Partner APIs (Connections / Communications)Your 1st-degree connections; invitations; messages (if approved).Low (until approved)LowRequires LinkedIn partner approval; Connections API cannot browse 2nd-degree connections.D. RPA/VM control + screen capturePotentially anything visible in UI (messages, connections, mutuals).Medium (technical)HighLikely conflicts with LinkedIn policies. Slow and brittle; should be "experimental" only.E. Third-party scraping/automation toolsSimilar to RPA (varies).MediumHighGenerally high policy and account-risk. Not recommended for a production baseline.6. Recommended solution (v1)6.1 Primary ingestion mode: Data archive importv1 uses the LinkedIn "Download your data" archive as the authoritative ingestion channel. This method provides strong coverage of connections and direct messages without requiring API partner access.6.2 Optional enrichment: Sign in with LinkedIn (OIDC)Add an optional OIDC login to confirm the account owner and enrich the "Me" profile (name, profile picture, email if allowed). This does not replace archive import; it improves identity confidence and UX.6.3 Future: Partner API mode (gated)If you later obtain LinkedIn approval for restricted scopes (e.g., first-degree connections and communications), the adapter can add incremental sync. However, this still will not enable browsing other members' connections-of-connections.7. Adapter contract and internal APIsThe LinkedIn adapter is a concrete implementation of WIG's generic SourceAdapter interface. It emits canonical events and stores raw references to support auditability and reprocessing.7.1 SourceAdapter interface (TypeScript)export type Cursor = string;export interface SourceAdapter {  sourceName: string; // "linkedin"  capabilities(): Promise<{    contacts: boolean;    organizations: boolean;    interactions: boolean;    content: boolean; // posts/articles  }>;  // Connection/authorization varies by adapter.  connect(input: ConnectInput): Promise<ConnectionState>;  // Job-based ingestion for long-running work.  startIngest(input: IngestRequest): Promise<{ jobId: string }>;  getJobStatus(jobId: string): Promise<JobStatus>;  // Optional incremental sync for API-based adapters.  startSync?(input: SyncRequest): Promise<{ jobId: string }>;  disconnect(): Promise<void>;}7.2 LinkedIn-specific ConnectInputexport type LinkedInConnectInput =  | { mode: "archive_upload" } // UI provides upload flow  | { mode: "oidc"; redirectUrl: string } // optional  | { mode: "partner_api"; oauthConfigId: string }; // future8. Canonical data mapping (LinkedIn  WIG graph)8.1 Canonical entities (nodes)Person (connections and message participants)Organization (if available from other sources; LinkedIn archive may include limited org data)Conversation (LinkedIn message threads)Message (individual DM events)Post / Article (your authored content; optional but valuable for topical relevance)EvidenceEvent (the canonical `proof' object that powers scoring and explainability)8.2 Canonical edgesME -[CONNECTED_TO]-> Person (from Connections export)Person -[PARTICIPATED_IN]-> ConversationME -[PARTICIPATED_IN]-> ConversationPerson/ME -[SENT]-> MessageMessage -[IN_CONVERSATION]-> ConversationME -[AUTHORED]-> Post/Article8.3 EvidenceEvent schema (required)EvidenceEvent {  id: string  subjectPersonId: string            // the person this evidence strengthens/weakens  objectPersonId?: string            // counterparty if relevant  type: "linkedin_connection"      | "linkedin_message_sent"      | "linkedin_message_received"      | "linkedin_post_authored"      | "linkedin_invitation_sent"      | "linkedin_invitation_received"      | "linkedin_comment_authored"      | "linkedin_reaction"          // if exported      | "human_confirmed_connection" // see Section 10  timestamp: Date  source: "linkedin_archive" | "linkedin_api" | "manual_confirmation"  rawRef?: { bucket: string; key: string; recordId?: string }  metadata: Record<string, any>      // thread id, message length, etc.}9. Archive ingestion: parsing specificationThe archive format is a ZIP containing CSV/JSON files and folders. Exact file names and columns can evolve; the parser must be version-tolerant.9.1 File discovery rulesTreat filenames case-insensitively (e.g., messages.csv vs Messages.csv).Support nested folder layouts.Ignore unknown files; log warnings for expected-but-missing files.Store the full raw ZIP and (optionally) extracted files for reproducibility under a retention policy.9.2 Minimum expected files (best-effort)Connections.csv - your first-degree connections (often includes connection date).messages.csv - direct messages (content and/or metadata).Shares.csv - your short-form posts.Articles/ - your long-form articles (folder).Optional: Comments.csv, Invitations.csv, Contacts.csv, Reactions.csv (if present).9.3 Parsing: Connections.csvFor each row:Upsert Person using the strongest available identifiers: LinkedIn profile URL/handle if present, otherwise (name + company + title).Create edge: ME CONNECTED_TO Person with connected_at if present.Emit EvidenceEvent(type=linkedin_connection, timestamp=connected_at).9.4 Parsing: messages.csvFor each message record:Upsert Conversation (thread) and participant memberships.Create Message event with sender, timestamp, and optionally body text (encrypted).Emit EvidenceEvent(type=linkedin_message_sent/received) to strengthen relationship scoring.9.5 Parsing: Shares.csv / ArticlesUpsert Post/Article content nodes and link them to ME as authored.Emit EvidenceEvent(type=linkedin_post_authored) to support topical relevance and activity recency signals.10. Identity resolution (LinkedIn-specific)LinkedIn export data frequently lacks unique universal identifiers and may omit emails for privacy. Therefore identity resolution must be conservative and auditable.10.1 Deterministic matches (auto-merge)Exact LinkedIn public profile URL match.Exact email match if exported/shared.Exact phone match if available from other sources and mapped to the same person.10.2 Probabilistic matches (review-queue unless very high confidence)Name similarity + same company + same title cluster.Name similarity + shared email domain inferred from other sources + location similarity.10.3 Required UX supportA Review Queue item must be created for borderline matches with a clear explanation of the matching features.All merges must be reversible (undo).11. Relationship strength scoring: LinkedIn signals11.1 FeaturesConnection age (connected_at) with decay if no interactions.Message recency (days since last inbound/outbound).Message frequency (rolling counts: 30/90/365 days).Reciprocity (two-way communication vs one-way).Thread depth (reply chains).Message richness (length, presence of meeting scheduling language; stored as metadata, not as raw text signals unless permitted).Multi-party conversations (community/cluster signal).11.2 Output stored on edgesstrength_score: 0..100strength_tier: A/B/C/Dtop_evidence: top 3 EvidenceEvents driving the score (for explainability)12. 'Other people's connections' - compliant designDirectly downloading other members' connection lists is generally not available via official APIs and is risky via automation. v1 implements three compliant mechanisms that still materially improve warm-intro discovery.12.1 Inferred edges from multi-party evidenceIf LinkedIn group conversations exist in the archive, participants imply a relationship signal among them.Email threads, CRM stakeholder lists, and group chats from other sources can infer additional edges (not `confirmed connections' but `co-participation' edges).12.2 Human-confirmed connection edges (recommended)When you request an intro to Target T, WIG can ask your connection C: "Are you connected to T and willing to intro?" If confirmed, create an edge C CONNECTED_TO T with EvidenceEvent(type=human_confirmed_connection).This yields high-signal, high-trust edges without needing to crawl LinkedIn.These confirmations become durable graph edges with timestamps and provenance.12.3 Opt-in expansion portal (future-ready)Allow trusted connectors to upload their own LinkedIn data archive into a limited-scope guest portal.Use explicit consent + strict data minimization (store only edges and non-sensitive metadata).This creates a lawful "expanded graph" built from voluntary contributors, not scraping.13. UI changes required13.1 Data Sources  LinkedInLinkedIn card with states: Not connected / Archive uploaded / Processing / Completed / Error.Upload control for ZIP; show last import time and record counts (connections, messages, posts).Ingestion log view per job (processed files, warnings, errors).Privacy controls: delete LinkedIn data; retention settings (metadata-only vs content).13.2 Person profile (LinkedIn tab)Show LinkedIn profile identifier (URL/handle if available).Show connection date and LinkedIn-derived strength breakdown (top evidence).Show message stats (counts + last interaction date) and optionally a mini timeline.13.3 Intro Finder graph viewEdge tooltip must show evidence summary (e.g., '12 messages in last 90 days', 'connected since 2018').Filters: 'Show LinkedIn evidence', 'Show inferred vs confirmed edges', 'Hide low-confidence merges'.Evidence side-panel groups evidence by edge along the selected path.13.4 Review QueueAdd LinkedIn-specific merge suggestions (name/company collisions) with side-by-side comparison.Require explicit approval for non-deterministic merges; support undo.14. Backend and data-layer changes14.1 Storage and retentionStore raw archive ZIP in object storage under raw/linkedin/<userId>/<jobId>/archive.zip.Optionally store extracted files for debugging with a configurable retention period.If message content is stored, use field-level encryption and restricted access controls.14.2 Ingestion pipeline (job-based)Create ingest_job row upon upload; status transitions: queued  running  completed/failed.Process ZIP in chunks to fit serverless runtime limits; checkpoint progress by file + row cursor.Emit canonical events to the event bus (e.g., contacts.ingested, interactions.ingested) to trigger entity resolution and graph recomputation.14.3 Schema additions (high level)data_source_connections (linkedin): connection status, mode, last_successful_ingest_at.ingest_jobs: job metadata, progress, logs, error summaries.linkedin_raw_records (optional): normalized raw rows keyed by job and source file.conversations, messages: thread and message events.evidence_events: required for scoring and explainability.15. Security, privacy, and complianceDefault to Compliant Mode (archive upload). Avoid scraping/automation approaches unless explicitly enabled as experimental.Treat LinkedIn message bodies as sensitive: encrypt at rest; support metadata-only storage.Provide data deletion (right-to-be-forgotten style) for all LinkedIn-derived artifacts.Maintain audit logs for ingestion, merges, and any outbound actions derived from LinkedIn evidence.16. Testing plan (mandatory)16.1 Unit testsCSV parsing correctness across encodings, delimiters, and line breaks.Idempotency: re-import of the same archive must not duplicate nodes/edges/messages.EvidenceEvent creation correctness and determinism.Scoring functions: golden test vectors for strength_score outputs.16.2 Integration testsFixture archive ZIP (sanitized) processed end-to-end into a test Postgres instance.Verify counts (persons, edges, conversations, messages, evidence_events) and referential integrity.16.3 End-to-end tests (Playwright)Upload archive  see job progress  completion state.Search for a known connection  view LinkedIn tab  evidence visible.Intro Finder: select target  see path using LinkedIn edges  edge tooltip shows evidence summary.Review Queue: approve/reject a LinkedIn merge suggestion  graph updates accordingly.17. Rollout planPhase 1: Ship archive upload + parsing for Connections.csv and messages.csv; graph scoring uses LinkedIn evidence.Phase 2: Expand parsing to posts/comments/invitations if present; add better evidence cards and filters in UI.Phase 3: Add OIDC sign-in for identity enrichment; improve merge confidence on `Me' and high-value connectors.Phase 4 (optional): Opt-in expansion portal + human-confirmed edges workflows.Phase 5 (if approved): Add Partner API mode for incremental sync.18. Open questionsDo you want to store full LinkedIn message bodies, or metadata-only by default? (Privacy vs utility tradeoff.)Do you want to support multiple LinkedIn accounts (personal + company) under one WIG user?What retention policy should apply to raw archives and extracted files?Should opt-in expansion be limited to a whitelist of trusted connectors?References[R1] LinkedIn Connections API (Microsoft Learn) - notes that you cannot browse connections; 2nd-degree connections are not available. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/integrations/people/connections-api[R2] LinkedIn Communication APIs overview (Microsoft Learn) - describes Invitations and Messages APIs (generally partner/approved access). https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/integrations/communications/overview[R3] Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect (Microsoft Learn) - OIDC sign-in for lite profile and email scopes. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/consumer/integrations/self-serve/sign-in-with-linkedin-v2[R4] hiQ Labs, Inc. v.
